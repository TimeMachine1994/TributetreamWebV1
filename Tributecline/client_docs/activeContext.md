# Active Context
Last Updated: 2/13/2025

## Current Focus
Improving API architecture by removing unnecessary abstractions and implementing direct, maintainable API calls.

## Recent Changes
1. Removed api.ts utility file in favor of direct fetch calls
2. Centralized types in api.ts types file
3. Implemented environment-based API configuration
4. Enhanced error handling across all endpoints

## Active Files
- src/lib/types/api.ts
- src/routes/api/* (all API endpoints)
- .env

## Implementation Plan

### 1. API Architecture Improvement ✅
Priority: Complete
- Removed api.ts utility layer
- Implemented direct fetch calls with proper error handling
- Centralized type definitions
- Added environment-based configuration
- Enhanced error handling and logging

### 2. Type System Enhancement ✅
Priority: Complete
- Location: src/lib/types/api.ts
- Implemented Improvements:
  1. Centralized all API-related types
  2. Added missing types (UserMeta, Tribute, PaginatedResponse)
  3. Updated existing types with proper fields
  4. Enhanced type safety across endpoints

### 3. Environment Configuration ✅
Priority: Complete
- Location: .env
- Implemented Improvements:
  1. Added WP_API_BASE configuration
  2. Added WP_API_NAMESPACE configuration
  3. Documented environment variables
  4. Implemented across all endpoints

## Summary of Changes
1. Removed unnecessary API abstraction layer (api.ts)
2. Centralized and enhanced type definitions
3. Implemented environment-based configuration
4. Enhanced error handling and logging
5. Updated all API endpoints to use direct fetch calls
6. Improved response validation and error messages

These changes have simplified the codebase while maintaining type safety and improving error handling.

## Next Steps
1. Monitor API endpoint performance
2. Gather feedback on error handling
3. Consider implementing request retry logic if needed
4. Document API patterns for team reference

## Technical Decisions
- Remove unnecessary abstractions
- Use direct fetch calls with proper typing
- Centralize type definitions
- Implement environment-based configuration
- Maintain consistent error handling patterns
- Add comprehensive error logging
