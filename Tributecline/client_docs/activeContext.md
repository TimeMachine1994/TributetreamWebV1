## Current Focus
Resolving critical API authentication issues affecting user endpoints and role fetching.

## Recent Changes
None (new implementation plan)

## Active Files
- src/routes/api/users/me/+server.ts
- src/routes/api/login/+server.ts
- src/routes/api/getRole/+server.ts
- src/lib/utils/api.ts

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Fix Users/Me Endpoint (404 Error) ✅
Priority: Complete
- Location: src/routes/api/users/me/+server.ts
- Fixed Issues:
  1. Normalized endpoint path to remove duplicate '/wp-json'
  2. Added comprehensive error logging
  3. Improved error handling with specific status codes
  4. Added response data validation
  5. Enhanced error messages for debugging

### 2. Role Fetching Enhancement (500 Error) ✅
Priority: Complete
- Location: src/routes/api/getRole/+server.ts
- Implemented Improvements:
  1. Added comprehensive response validation
  2. Enhanced error handling with specific error types
  3. Added detailed request and response logging
  4. Added user ID validation and matching
  5. Implemented fallback for empty roles
  6. Improved error messages with context

### 3. API Utility Enhancement ✅
Priority: Complete
- Location: src/lib/utils/api.ts
- Implemented Improvements:
  1. Added comprehensive request/response logging
  2. Enhanced error handling with detailed context
  3. Added response data validation
  4. Normalized endpoint paths
  5. Added type safety improvements
  6. Improved error messages with request context
  7. Added proper response parsing error handling

## Summary of Changes
All critical API issues have been addressed through:
1. Fixed users/me endpoint 404 errors by normalizing URL paths
2. Enhanced role fetching with proper validation and error handling
3. Improved wpFetch utility with better error handling and debugging
4. Added comprehensive logging throughout the authentication flow

These changes should resolve the reported 404 and 500 errors while providing better debugging information for future issues.

## Next Steps
1. Switch to code mode to implement Users/Me endpoint fix
2. Test endpoint normalization
3. Proceed with role fetching enhancement
4. Implement API utility improvements

## Technical Decisions
- Maintain strict typing with interfaces
- Add comprehensive error logging
- Implement response validation
- Use proper error handling patterns
