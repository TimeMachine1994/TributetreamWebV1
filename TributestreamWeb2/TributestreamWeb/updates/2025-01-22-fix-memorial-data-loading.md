# Fix: Memorial Form Data Loading in Confirmation Page

## Title
fix(confirmation): Resolve undefined memorial_form_data error and improve type safety

## Description
Fixed a critical issue in the confirmation page where accessing `memorial_form_data` was causing a TypeError. Implemented proper data flow between server and client components, added TypeScript interfaces, and improved error handling.

## Changes Made
1. Fixed data flow in `+page.ts`:
   - Correctly passing through all server data (appId, locationId, userMeta)
   - Ensuring proper data structure alignment

2. Added TypeScript interfaces in `types.ts`:
   - Created `UserMeta` interface for form data
   - Defined `PageData` interface for page props
   - Improved type safety across components

3. Enhanced error handling in `+page.svelte`:
   - Added optional chaining for safer data access
   - Implemented warning messages for missing data
   - Added validation for Square configuration
   - Improved error logging

4. Improved Layout in `+page.svelte`:
   - Added container with max-width constraint
   - Made schedule and calculate forms thinner to match width of three boxes
   - Improved responsive layout with proper spacing
   - Added consistent width constraints using Tailwind classes

## Technical Details
- Location: `/src/routes/fd-form/confirmation/`
- Files Modified:
  - `+page.ts`
  - `+page.svelte`
  - Added new file: `types.ts`

## Testing
- Handles missing memorial_form_data gracefully
- Maintains functionality when data is incomplete
- Provides clear error messages for debugging
