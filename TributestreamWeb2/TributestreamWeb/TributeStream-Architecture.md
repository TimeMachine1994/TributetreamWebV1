# TributeStream Web Architecture Documentation

## Executive Summary

TributeStream is a SvelteKit 5-based web application that provides livestreaming services for celebration of life events. The application integrates with a WordPress backend via REST APIs and uses JWT for authentication. The system allows users to create, manage, and view tribute pages with associated livestreams.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies
- Frontend: SvelteKit 5 with TypeScript
- Backend: WordPress REST API
- Authentication: JWT
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- State Management: Svelte stores
- API Integration: Custom WordPress endpoints

- `/why-tributestream` - Information page
- `/how-it-works` - Process explanation
- `/contact` - Contact information
- `/schedule` - Scheduling page
- `/celebration-of-life-for-[slug]` - Individual tribute pages

### Authentication Routes
- `/login` - User login
- `/create-account` - Account creation

### Protected Routes
- `/dashboard` - User dashboard
- `/dashboard/create-tributestream` - Tribute creation
- `/dashboard/tributestream-archive` - Archive view
- `/admin` - Admin dashboard
- `/admin/livestreams/[slug]` - Livestream management
- `/admin/users` - User management
- `/account-settings` - User settings

## Core Functionality

### 1. Tribute Creation Flow
- User enters loved one's name
- System generates unique URL
- User provides contact information
- Page creation with WordPress integration
- Email notification system

### 2. Livestreaming
- Stream scheduling
- Stream status management
- Video URL management
- Stream order handling

### 3. User Management
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Profile management
- Admin capabilities

## Data Management

### API Services

#### WordPressApiService
- Handles all WordPress REST API interactions
- Manages CRUD operations for:
  - Family POC Profiles
  - Tribute Pages
  - Streams
  - Payments
- Implements duplicate prevention for memorial links
- Handles media uploads (CloudFlare integration planned)

#### LivestreamService
- Manages livestream creation and management
- Implements data validation using Zod
- Handles stream status updates

### State Management

The application uses Svelte stores for state management:

```typescript
// User Authentication
userIdStore: Manages current user ID
jwtStore: Handles JWT token storage

// Application State
drawerStore: Controls mobile navigation
```

## Development Standards and Best Practices

### TypeScript Usage
1. Use TypeScript for all new code
2. Define interfaces for all data structures
3. Enable strict type checking
4. Avoid `any` type unless absolutely necessary
5. Use proper type annotations for function parameters and return types

### Component Development
1. Follow SvelteKit's file-based routing conventions
2. Keep components focused and single-purpose
3. Use TypeScript for component props
4. Implement proper error boundaries
5. Use Svelte's built-in stores for state management
6. Follow the principle of least privilege

### Code Organization
1. Group related functionality in services
2. Keep business logic separate from components
3. Use proper file naming conventions:
   - Components: PascalCase.svelte
   - Services: camelCase.ts
   - Utilities: camelCase.ts
4. Maintain clear separation of concerns

### API Integration
1. Use service classes for API calls
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Add request caching where appropriate
4. Use proper TypeScript types for API responses
5. Implement retry logic for failed requests

### State Management
1. Use Svelte stores appropriately
2. Implement proper state persistence
3. Handle loading and error states
4. Use derived stores for computed values
5. Implement proper state synchronization

### Testing
1. Write unit tests for critical functionality
2. Implement integration tests for API calls
3. Add end-to-end tests for critical user flows
4. Use proper test naming conventions
5. Maintain good test coverage

## Technical Debt & Improvement Opportunities

### 1. Authentication
- Current Implementation:
  - Basic JWT token management
  - Token storage in localStorage
  - Simple validation checks

- Improvements Needed:
  - Implement refresh token mechanism
  - Add token expiration handling
  - Enhance security with HTTP-only cookies
  - Add proper token rotation

### 2. API Integration
- Current Implementation:
  - Direct API calls in components
  - Basic error handling
  - Simple retry logic

- Improvements Needed:
  - Implement proper API error handling
  - Add request caching
  - Implement proper retry strategies
  - Add request queuing for offline support

### 3. State Management
- Current Implementation:
  - Basic Svelte stores
  - Limited persistence
  - No synchronization

- Improvements Needed:
  - Implement proper state persistence
  - Add state synchronization
  - Implement proper loading states
  - Add optimistic updates

### 4. Code Organization
- Current Implementation:
  - Basic service structure
  - Mixed concerns in components
  - Incomplete TypeScript usage

- Improvements Needed:
  - Implement proper service layer
  - Separate business logic from components
  - Complete TypeScript migration
  - Add proper documentation

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Implement proper authentication flow
2. Add comprehensive error handling
3. Complete TypeScript migration

### Phase 2: Feature Enhancement
1. Add offline support
2. Implement proper caching
3. Add real-time updates

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization
1. Implement proper code splitting
2. Add proper asset optimization
3. Implement proper SEO

## Questions for Future Development

1. Authentication:
   - Should we implement OAuth2 for third-party integration?
   - How should we handle token refresh?
   - What security measures need to be added?

2. State Management:
   - Should we implement a more robust state management solution?
   - How should we handle offline state?
   - What data should be persisted?

3. Performance:
   - What metrics should we track?
   - How can we optimize the initial load?
   - What caching strategies should we implement?

4. Scalability:
   - How should we handle increased user load?
   - What infrastructure changes are needed?
   - How can we optimize database queries?

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Implement proper authentication flow
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Complete TypeScript migration

2. **Short-term Improvements**
   - Add proper caching
   - Implement offline support
   - Add real-time updates

3. **Long-term Goals**
   - Implement proper monitoring
   - Add analytics
   - Implement proper testing

## Conclusion

The TributeStream web application provides a solid foundation for livestreaming celebration of life events. While there are areas that need improvement, the core functionality is well-implemented. Following the recommended roadmap and development standards will help create a more robust and maintainable application.
