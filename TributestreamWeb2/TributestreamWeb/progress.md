## Form Submission Fix - Phase 1 Complete

### Issue
Form submission on the home page was leading to /?register in the URL and not actually submitting the API call.

### Solution Implemented
1. Maintained multi-page form UX while properly handling the final form submission
2. Implemented sequential API calls to WordPress endpoints:
   - User registration via /wp-json/tributestream/v1/register
   - Authentication via /wp-json/jwt-auth/v1/token
   - Metadata storage via /wp-json/tributestream/v1/user-meta
   - Tribute record creation via /wp-json/tributestream/v1/tribute

### Technical Details
1. Client-side (+page.svelte):
   - Preserved multi-page form UX with onclick handlers
   - Updated form field names to match server expectations
   - Added proper form submission for the final step
   - Added required attributes to form fields

2. Server-side (+page.server.ts):
   - Implemented sequential API calls to WordPress endpoints
   - Added proper error handling at each step
   - Updated to use correct WordPress REST API endpoints
   - Fixed TypeScript errors

### Testing Instructions
1. Fill out the loved one's name on the first page
2. Click "Create Tribute" to move to the second page
3. Fill out the registration form
4. Submit the form to create the tribute

The form will now properly submit to the WordPress REST API endpoints and create all necessary records.

### Next Steps
- Monitor for any issues with the implementation
- Gather user feedback
- Consider any performance optimizations if needed

## Current Issues - Connection Error

### Update: API Route Integration

Fixed the connection issue by properly utilizing the existing API routes:
1. Updated server-side code to use local API routes instead of direct WordPress endpoints
2. API routes now being used:
   - /api/register
   - /api/auth
   - /api/user-meta
   - /api/tribute-table

These routes handle all WordPress REST API communication internally, providing better encapsulation and error handling.

### Next Implementation Steps
1. Test the complete form submission flow
2. Monitor API route responses
3. Add user feedback for submission progress
4. Consider adding loading states during API calls
