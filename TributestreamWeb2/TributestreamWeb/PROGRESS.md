# Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Initial Setup âœ“
- Basic project structure
- Development environment
- Core dependencies

## Phase 2: Server Endpoints âœ“
- Created `/api/admin/users` endpoint with full CRUD operations
- Created `/api/admin/tributes` endpoint with custom post type support
- Added JWT authentication and admin checks
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Consolidated and standardized API responses

### Impact on Phase 3
The completion of Phase 2 provides several advantages for Phase 3 (Frontend Implementation):

1. **API Contract**
   - Clear endpoint structure (`/api/admin/*`)
   - Standardized response formats
   - Well-defined error handling
   - TypeScript interfaces for data types

2. **Data Flow**
   - Tributes data includes custom fields (loved_one_name, custom_html)
   - User data includes all necessary fields (id, name, email, roles)
   - Proper pagination support for lists
   - Search functionality built-in

3. **Authentication**
   - JWT handling is in place
   - Admin role checks implemented
   - Token refresh flow established

## Phase 3: Frontend Implementation ðŸš§
### Ready to Start
- [x] Admin dashboard overview page
- [x] Users list view
- [x] Tributes list view
- [ ] User detail view
- [ ] Tribute detail view
- [ ] Media management
- [ ] Settings page

### Dependencies from Phase 2
1. **API Integration**
   - Can use established endpoints
   - TypeScript types are available
   - Error handling patterns defined

2. **Authentication Flow**
   - JWT token management ready
   - Admin role checks in place
   - Protected route structure defined

3. **Data Management**
   - Real-time updates via API
   - Proper caching headers set
   - Optimistic updates possible

### Next Steps
1. Implement remaining admin views
2. Add media management features
3. Implement settings management
4. Add real-time updates where needed
5. Implement proper loading states
6. Add error boundaries and fallbacks

## Future Phases
- Phase 4: Testing & QA
- Phase 5: Deployment & DevOps
- Phase 6: Documentation & Handoff

## Notes
- Phase 2 completion ensures stable API foundation
- Frontend can be developed with confidence in data structure
- Error handling patterns are established
- Performance considerations are in place
