## 3. Phase 2: Establish/Review Server Endpoints ✓

### Objective
Create SvelteKit endpoints for users and tributes that act as intermediaries between the SvelteKit front end and the WordPress plugin.

### Implementation Status

1. **File Structure** ✓
   - Created `/src/routes/api/admin/users/+server.ts`
   - Created `/src/routes/api/admin/tributes/+server.ts`
   - Implemented in TypeScript for better type safety

2. **Methods Implemented** ✓
   - **GET**: 
     - List view with pagination using `?page=` and `?per_page=`
     - Single item lookup with `?id=`
     - Search functionality with `?search=`
   - **POST**: Create new resources
   - **PUT**: Update existing resources
   - **DELETE**: Remove resources

3. **JWT Authentication** ✓
   - Added JWT token retrieval from cookies
   - Implemented admin access checks via `locals.user?.isAdmin`
   - Attached tokens to WordPress API requests
   - Added proper error handling for unauthorized access

4. **Route Consolidation** ✓
   - Removed duplicate `/api/user_data` endpoint
   - Unified all user operations under `/api/admin/users`
   - Unified all tribute operations under `/api/admin/tributes`
   - Standardized error responses and status codes

### Implementation Details

Each endpoint follows these patterns:
- Validates admin access and JWT authentication
- Handles query parameters for pagination and search
- Forwards requests to WordPress plugin endpoints:
  - Users: `wp.tributestream.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users`
  - Tributes: `wp.tributestream.com/wp-json/tributestream/v1/tributes`
- Returns formatted responses with proper error handling
- Includes TypeScript types for request/response data

The endpoints are now ready for integration with the frontend admin dashboard.
